I'm second year CAPP student from Ensenada, Mexico. Before joining Harris, I studied Economics in Tijuana, Mexico and worked for 3 years in policy design and data analysis to improve school attainment in the south of Mexico. 

I joined the CAPP program with the intention of improve my skills in terms of data collection, processing and analyzis to continue my previous work.

FUN FACT: I acquired "How Charts Lie" a couple of years ago.
