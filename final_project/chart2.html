  <h1>Is the main reason for leaving the school in 2020 related to the COVID-19 pandemic?</h1>

  <p><a href="https://www.inegi.org.mx/investigacion/ecovided/2020/#Microdatos">Raw data available in this link</a></p>
  <p>It is estimated that around 740,000 students of all levels did not conclude school in 2020. Among those students, 
    more than half mention that the COVID pandemic was the main reason. While it is technically impossible to affirm 
    that all of these student would have stayed in school if the pandemic did not happened (as we lack a counterfactual), 
    it is clear that there is a strong impact on the enrollment rates.</p>
