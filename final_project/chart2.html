  <h1>Is the main reason for leaving the school in 2020 related to the COVID-19 pandemic?</h1>

  <p><a href="https://www.inegi.org.mx/investigacion/ecovided/2020/#Microdatos">Raw data available in this link</a></p>
  <p>It is estimated that around 740,000 students of all levels did not conclude school in 2020. Among those students, 
    more than half mention that the COVID pandemic was the main reason. While it is technically impossible to affirm 
    that all of these student would have stayed in school if the pandemic did not happened (as we lack a counterfactual), 
    it is clear that there is a strong impact on school dropout.</p>
  <p>The imposibility to actually take classes definitely played a big role in the performance and motivation of students. 
    In a press conference held on August 19th 2021, the president of the Human Rights Comision of Mexico City, mentioned 
    that a survey on children and teenagers conducted by the commision showed that 70% of surveyed wanted to return to the 
    classrooms, and that 37% of them felt that they learned better in classrooms<sup>2</sup>. By the time of this survey, students had 
    already spent 18 months without going to the classroom.
  </p>
  <p>Furthermore, a series of additional problems like high levels of stress and anxiety<sup>3</sup>
  and several economic problems, led around 435,000 students to not conclude the scholar year because of COVID.</p>  
  <p>The following chart shows a better disagreggation of the motives related to COVID that the 58.9 share of students
    mention to abandon school.
