      <h2>The Announcement</h2>
      <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
        and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

        to live at first hand the effects of the pandemic on the students, particularly students from rural areas in the 
        south of Mexico. Furthermore, my mom is an elementary school teacher who during the pandemic turned our laundry
        room into a classroom so she could keep teaching her 8 year old students remotely.
