      <h2>The COVID-19 Pandemic on Mexican Education</h2>
      <p>It is February 28th, and the Secretariat of Health announces the first case of 
        COVID 19 in Mexico. On March 23rd, the Mexican government announces a Public Health plan called "Jornada 
      Nacional de Sana Distancia". This plan involves the suspension of many activities, including in person classes.
    While it is evident that the </p>

      <h2>The choice of topic</h2>
      <p>I chose this topic because my academic and life experiences have made me passionate about education and welfare. 
        Before joining the University of Chicago, I had the opportunity to work for a <a href="https://escalera.org/">non profit</a> 
        where I had the chance to live at first hand the effects of the pandemic on students living in rural communities in the Mexican 
        state of Chiapas. When the restrictions were announced, we knew that we were going to face a lot of challenges, since the students
        we served did not have the tools to study remotely, and many would be forced to abandon school to support their families. 
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, my mom is an elementary school teacher who during the pandemic converted our laundry
        room into a classroom so she could keep teaching her 8 year old students remotely. However, not all of the children
        had a computer or a good internet connection to join the classes.

      <h2>The Data</h2>
      <p><a href="https://www.inegi.org.mx/investigacion/ecovided/2020/#Documentacion">The National Survey to Measure the Impact of COVID-19 on the Education 2020</a> was collected by the 
        National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) between 2020 and 2021, covering data for students at 
        all levels, in the ages between 3 and 9. 
      </p>
      <p>When I found this survey, I immediately raised several questions in my head: How many students 
        left the school due to the pandemic? Was the impact of the pandemic equal between men and women? 
        Were all the states equally affected?
