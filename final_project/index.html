      <h2>The COVID-19 Pandemic on Mexican Education</h2>
      <p>It is February 28th, and the Secretariat of Health announces the first case of 
        COVID 19 in Mexico. On March 16th, the Mexican government announces the suspension 
        of in person classes<sup>1</sup>. As a substitute for the in-person activities, national televised classes
      and remote teaching are proposed.</p>
      <p>In a country like Mexico, it is clear that not all of the students will be ready for a remote education. Many will 
    certainly abandon school, and some might not come back. How this situation actually looks like? That's what I explore
  in this project.</p>

      <h2>The choice of topic</h2>
      <p>I chose this topic because my academic and life experiences have made me passionate about education and welfare. 
        Before joining the University of Chicago, I had the opportunity to work for a <a href="https://escalera.org/">non profit</a> 
        where I had the chance to live at first hand the effects of the pandemic on students living in rural communities in the Mexican 
        state of Chiapas. When the restrictions were announced, we knew that we were going to face a lot of challenges, since the students
        we served did not have the tools to study remotely, and many would be forced to abandon school permanently to support their families. 
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, my mom is an elementary school teacher who during the pandemic converted our laundry
        room into a classroom so she could keep teaching her 8 year old students remotely. However, not all of the children
        had a computer or a good internet connection to join the classes, raising challenges regarding equal access to education

      <h2>The Data</h2>
      <p><a href="https://www.inegi.org.mx/investigacion/ecovided/2020/#Documentacion">The National Survey to Measure the Impact of COVID-19 on the Education 2020</a> was collected by the 
        National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) between 2020 and 2021, covering data for students at 
        all levels, in the ages between 3 and 29. 
      </p>
      <p>When I found this survey, I immediately raised several questions in my head: How many students 
        left the school due to the pandemic? Was the impact of the pandemic equal between men and women? 
        Were all the states equally affected?
    </p>
    <p>The main challenges behind this data, was the searching for a story inside of the data. When I first looked at the survey
      and the data, it was hard to identify how the structure of the survey would help me to find some interesting insights and make 
      the comparisons that I wanted to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of coding, there were also some challenges and bugs along the way, especially with the map chart. However, those are
      the type of challenges that help someone actually learn.

      <h2>The Result</h2>
      <p>I have chosen graphics that communicate the questions that I raised when I started this project. One 
        of the huge advantages of the data, is that it was conducted using a representative sample, and providing
        weights for each answer, so I can be sure that the graphs are a truthful representation of the effects of 
        the pandemic. 
      </p>
      <p>My intention is to share my concerns the status of Mexican students with the people who look at this project. 
        All comments, critiques and suggestions are more than welcomed.
