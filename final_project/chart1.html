  <p>After 740,000 students did not finish school, the next question we have to ask ourselves is if these students
    are going to be back at school at some point. I was particularly interested in understanding this question at 
    gender level, under the hypothesis that maybe women would be less likely to return to school, given certain social 
    beliefs in Mexico.
  </p>
  <p>The results of the survey show that there were no significant differences in terms of the willingness to return 
    to school at gender level. However, the real concern behind this chart is the fact that around 22% of students 
    (when considering both genders) already decided to abandon school, no matter the decision of the government, while around 18% are unlikely to return.
