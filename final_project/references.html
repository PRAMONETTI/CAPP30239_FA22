  <h1>What are the next challenges for Mexican Education Policy?</h1>
  <p>It has been clear that the pandemic affected many students around the world, and Mexico was not the exception.
    The pandemic showed us in a higher scale something that, as a society, we already knew; that Mexico is a country
    with high levels of inequality and where many people do not possess the same resources to overpass periods of crisis. 
  </p>
  <p>The pandemic left many students out of classroom for a year and half, and forced at least 435,000 to abandon school. It estimated that
    as a result of the pandemic, Mexicans will lose on average 1.8 years of scholarity on average<sup>4,5</sup>. Our goal
  must be to recover those years and help students to go back to school.</p>
  <p>The students who did not leave school, will also face many challenges, since they have lost a lot of valuable time out of 
    classrooms. This represents a lot of learning that needs to be recovered.
  </p>
  <p>It is up to policy leaders to change this trend and guarantee a better education for future generations.</p>
