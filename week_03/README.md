### Description of the Data

This data represents a survey collection of more than 11,000 individuals, where the Mexican government tried to understand how COVID-19 impacted families in terms of 
school enrollment and education access. 

### Why I am interested in this topic?

Education has been one of my main topics of interest since I started my professional career. For 2 and a half years, I worked at a non-profit in the south of Mexico, 
where we designed interventions to help students from rural communities to enroll to high school. When the pandemic arrived, we faced a lot of challenges, since our 
students represented a population with no access to technologies.

Furthermore, my mother is an elementary school teacher who, during the pandemic, turned our laundry room into a classroom so she could continue teaching through 
remote classes, with most of her students connecting through a smartphone from one of their parents. I think that this project it's something she woulk like to see.

### How I would hope to use this data?

I would mostly like to compare how the pandemic affected different segments of the population. On one side, I would like to compare the different states of Mexico, and
also do a gender analysis.

### Potential data points

- School dropout per state
- School dropout per gender
- Access to technologies per state
- Main reason for dropping school due to COVID, per state/gender

Data points will be defined as the project goes, since the survey has a lot of data to handle with. 

### Concerns about the data

So far, data looks good, as it includes a good amount of observations (11,000) as well as weights to properly compare states. 

### Type of source

Primary

### Location of the data

You can file all the documents related to this data inside of data_final_project folder.
